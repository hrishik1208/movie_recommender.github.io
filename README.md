## Features

- User can get movie recommendations, depending on whether they **like** or **dislike** another movie. 
- Users can **search for a movie** (which are available in the dataset) through a **search bar** and get some related informations regarding that movie. Some of the informations are - 
    * **Title** of the movie with **release year**
    * **Genres** of the movie
    * **Top Casts** of the movie
    * **Directors** of the movie
- Users will get *suggestions* while searching for the movies through the search bar **(suggestions on search)**.  
- For calculating scores for every movie for recommendation purpose, the following criterias have been taken into consideration-
    * **Title** of the movie (For example - If someone searches for "Toy Story", then the engine will recommend other parts of the same series like "Toy Story 2", "Toy Story 3" etc.) 
    * **Casts / Directors** of the movie (For example - If someone likes to watch movies of Christopher Nolan, then chances are that he/she would also like to watch other movies from the same person)
    * **Overview** of the movie (Movies which have similar words in their descriptions are more likely to get recommended on each others recommendations list)
    * **Genres** of the movie (This is one of the most important and straight forward criteria for recommendation. User liking a particular genre of movie is likely to watch other movies from the same genre too)
- Clean, minimalistic and **responsive** UI for seamless user experience.
